# Esperanta-Vortaro-2
A reiteration of my Esperanto dictionary using a .NET backend, Angular front end, and MySQL database.

I re-made <a href="https://github.com/miacoupland/Esperanta-Vortaro">my old project</a>, Esperanta-Vortaro, to demonstrate some basic abilities with .NET and Angular. I'm trying to build more full stack projects, so I started off by creating a MySQL database on my local machine. I edited the database using DBeaver to get it started off. Then, I used C# to make a backend. I just set up basic functionality to get an entry and add an entry. I used Entity Framework Core to interact with the MySQL database. I used Angular to build a very basic front end to add some forms for user interactions.
